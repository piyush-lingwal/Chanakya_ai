## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional answer sheet evaluation is:

* Time-consuming (weeks to check lakhs of copies).
* Costly (large workforce of evaluators required).
* Inconsistent (human bias, fatigue, errors).
* Provides limited feedback to students.

## 💡 Solution – Chanakya AI

Chanakya AI uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Base integration, and Machine Learning** to evaluate student answers. It compares answers against reference material (syllabus, textbooks, websites, question papers) and assigns marks based on accuracy, relevance, and depth.

With adjustable strictness levels, institutions can decide how lenient or strict evaluations should be.
